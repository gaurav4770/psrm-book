Let the <b>distance of node <i>Y</i></b> be the distance from the <b>initial node</b> to <i>Y</i>. Dijkstra's algorithm will assign some initial distance values and will try to improve them step by step (this is being modified.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" style="">

<li>Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.</li>
<li>Mark all nodes unvisited. Set the initial node as current. Create a set of the unvisited nodes called the <i>unvisited set</i> consisting of all the nodes.</li>
<li>For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their <i>tentative</i> distances. Compare the newly calculated <i>tentative</i> distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node <i>A</i> is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor <i>B</i> has length 2, then the distance to <i>B</i> (through <i>A</i>)
 will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater 
than 8 then change it for 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.</li>
<li>When we are done considering all of the neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the <i>unvisited set</i>. A visited node will never be checked again.</li>
<li>If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a 
route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance 
among the nodes in the <i>unvisited set</i> is infinity (when planning a
 complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the 
initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm 
has finished.</li>
<li>Select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative
 distance, and set it as the new "current node" then go back to step 3.</li>
